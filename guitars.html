      <h2>Model C503 – Curved Grand Auditorium Acoustic</h2>
      <p>The Model C503 is a refined interpretation of the classic Grand Auditorium, reimagined with a more pronounced waist and graceful curvature for both aesthetic elegance and tonal clarity. With a body length of 503 mm, a wide 394 mm lower bout, and a sculpted 208 mm waist, this guitar strikes a beautiful balance between power and precision.
The tightened waist enhances midrange focus and player comfort, while the generous lower bout delivers a strong, open bass response. A slightly smaller upper bout improves articulation and ergonomics without sacrificing volume. Ideal for both fingerstyle and light strumming, the C503 offers a clear, balanced voice with excellent projection and a touch of warmth.
The cutaway is in the Venetian style, although Florentine cutaways are also possible.
Whether in the studio or on stage, this custom body shape delivers a responsive and expressive experience — blending modern versatility with a handcrafted, classical influence.

      <h2>Model C473 – Concert Classical Guitar</h2>
      <p>The Model C473 is a carefully crafted classical guitar with a body length of 473 mm, designed for tonal balance, elegant response, and a contemporary feel. Inspired by traditional Spanish designs but subtly reshaped for improved projection and clarity, it features a slightly smaller body and a full-depth profile to enhance warmth and volume.
The soundboard is built with asymmetrical fan bracing, bringing the treble side subtly forward for better separation and brilliance in the upper registers. A lighter, more flexible bass side supports warmth and sustain without sacrificing clarity. This dynamic voicing results in a guitar that delivers rich bass with clean, expressive trebles — overcoming the common imbalance found in many classical guitars.
The rosette, purfling, and custom detailing reflect a commitment to clean, handcrafted aesthetics. With a 52 mm nut, a 650 mm scale, and a carefully profiled neck, the C473 offers the tactile feel and articulation that classical players expect — whether on stage, in the studio, or for personal expression.
