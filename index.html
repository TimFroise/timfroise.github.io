    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>My journey into guitar building began with a love for both craftsmanship and music. I initially studied engineering and later architecture, both of which gave me a foundation in precision and design — skills that quietly laid the groundwork for luthiery.

In my twenties, I attempted to build my first guitar. It wasn’t perfect, but it planted the seed. I’ve been playing and repairing guitars ever since, learning steadily through hands-on experience and curiosity.

A few years ago, I returned to guitar making with greater focus and purpose. Since then, I’ve refined my techniques, improved my setup, and dedicated myself to building instruments that are responsive, balanced, and thoughtfully crafted.

Each guitar I build is an expression of my ongoing exploration — shaped by hand, guided by ear, and built with the player in mind.</p>
